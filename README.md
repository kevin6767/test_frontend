# test_frontend

In this project I learned how to use Bootstrap and Scss. I learned how to put in a Scss loader into Webpack and I learned how to use
Bootstrap more efficiently for my projects. 

Bootstrap is an incredible help to the use of my Apps becuase of it's ability to take over the CSS completely for me. However, I wanted to
learn SCSS as well so if I needed to deep dive into Boostrap controlled, I could use SCSS to work on that as well. 

I'm continuing to learn React modules faster and faster. GitHub has been a great help as seeing my progress makes me push forward.
